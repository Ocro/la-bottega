---- API ----
- Use HTTP REST Methods to make API CRUD call (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) instead of passing the CRUD methods in the request body.

---- Angular ----
- Use async pipe with Observable instead of using Promise (need to rework all services and components).
- Improve search pipe by removing special char (éàè, etc) in the search terms. Find a better (and more complex) algorithm.
- Make specs files (testing!).
